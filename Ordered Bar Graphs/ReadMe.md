__NOTE: This is WORK IN PROGRESS__

Program to make a horizontal bargraphs where each bar is the mean (or percent of 1) in a multiple response question and the label is displayed 
right next to the bars. Moreover, the bars are arranged in a descending/ascending order. Such a graph is easier to read / understand since it does away with the
need to match colours in the legend with the bars. Which means, we can get rid of the legend completely.
