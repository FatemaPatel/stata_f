This program creates a simple freqency table directly in the browser/editor window as opposed to the results window as in the in-built tabluate command. You can export the output as an excel file. Needless to say, options that apply while exporting as excel can be used.

The output also shows missing values (thus, it is the equivalent of the output from "tab variable, m") . I will put up the version without missing values shortly.

Sweet! :cupcake:\
But how do I use it? :thinking:
    
1) Just change certain things as mentioned in the .do file. That is- enter your directory or paths, provide your dataset, change the variable names at the very bottom and/or rename label file name in two places (optional).
2) Run the entire .do file (prefrably at once if you don't understand what the codes are doing) after you've made the changes mentioned above. That's it.
